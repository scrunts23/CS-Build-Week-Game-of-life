# Conway's Game of life 

Conway's Game of Life is a game invented by the British mathematician Conway around 1970. Even though it is a game, all the user can do is decide the initial placement of life, and then enjoy the changes on the screen. It is like a kaleidoscope or a crystal ball.

Conway's Game of Life consists of very simple rules (see below) in which various shapes are produced based upon the four simple rules. The behaviors seem to be very complex and feels like acutally life. The emergence of complex behaviors based upon these rules of Conways's Game of Life exhibit emergence, which is one of the keys in the field of artificial life. 

The interesting thing about Conway's Game of Life is that there can be objects within the life in the world of Conway's Game (so does that mean there is something living in my computer?). Not all organisms are made of proteins that we know so the essence of life is self-replication which does not matter whether it is made of protein or software.

Among those who studied the self-reproduction of living things in the virtual world of life games are John von Neumann (who invented the principle of personal computers) and Christopher Langton (one of the founders ofthe field of artificial life). Both of these indviduals have actually created a self-replicating loops and succeeded in reproducing the same phenomenon as living things.

# Rules
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
  
  1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
  2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
  3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
  4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
  
  The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
